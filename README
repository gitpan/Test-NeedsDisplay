NAME
    Test::NeedsDisplay - Ensure that tests needing a display have one

SYNOPSIS
    In your Makefile.PL...

      use inc::Module::Install; 
      # ... or whatever else you use
  
      # Check for a display
      use Test::NeedsDisplay;
  
      # ... your Makefile.PL content as normal
  
    And again in each test script that loads Wx

      #!/usr/bin/perl
  
      use strict;
  
      use Test::NeedsDisplay;
  
      # Test content as normal...

DESCRIPTION
    When testing GUI applications, sometimes applications or modules
    absolutely insist on a display, even just to load a module without
    actually showing any objects.

    Regardless, this makes GUI applications pretty much impossible to build
    and test on headless or automated systems. And it fails to the point of
    not even running the Makefile.PL script because a dependency needs a
    display so it can be loaded to find a version.

    In these situations, what is needed is a fake display.

    The "Test::NeedsDisplay" module will search around and try to find a way
    to load some sort of display that can be used for the testing.

  Strategies for Finding a Display
    At this time, only a single method is used (and a very simple one).

    Debian Linux has a script called "xvfb-run" which is a wrapper for the
    "xvfb", a virtual X server which uses the linux frame buffer.

    When loaded without a viable display, the module will re-exec the same
    script using something like (for example) "xvfb-run test.t".

    As such, it should be loaded as early as possible, before anything has a
    chance to change script parameters. These params will be resent through
    to the script again.

METHODS
    There are no methods. You simply use the module as early as possible,
    probably right after "use strict;" and make sure to load it with only
    default params.

    Specifically, need must always load it before you set the test plan,
    otherwise the test script will report two plans, and the harness will
    complain about it and die.

      # Use it like this ...
      use Test::NeedsDisplay;
  
      # ... not like this ...
      use Test::NeedsDisplay 'anything';
  
      # ... and not like this.
      use Test::NeedsDisplay ();

    And that's all there is to do. The module will take care of the rest.

TO DO
    - Find alternative ways to launch a display on different platforms
